            <h2>Aaron Irizarry</h2>
            <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

            <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
            <br>In Aaron&#8217s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small, as well as sharing what these teams, departments and companies have that others don&#8217t.

            <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design inspiration from Filmmaker</h5>
            
            <p>Films succeed in evoking responces and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It is the filmmakers job to put this together. To do so they&#8127ve developed processes, tools amd techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
            <br>With this workshop, we&#8217ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets and storyboards.</p>

            <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>

            <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS AND JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process, Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>

            <p>Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional approach to the high jump with an unorthodox "back first" technique that became known as the Fosbury Flop. His innovative approach to a sport that seemed to have reached its limits was ridiculed at first, with sportswriters labeling him "the world&#8217s laziest high jumper" - but today variations of the Fosbury Flop are used by almosy every high jumper.
            <br>As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct analogues, and to free ourselves from outdated ideas so that we can develop the new interfaces and interactions of the future.</p>

Wether you&#8217re trying to encourage people - or yourself - to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game mechanics and play could be the trump card you&#8217re looking for.</p>

            <h5>Teaching Our CSS to Play Nice</h5>

            <p>Talk abstract: As our websites, applications and teams grow larger and more complicated, so does our CSS. Before we know it, we find ourselves no longer with cute little stylesheets, but sprawling, surly teenaged CSS that doesn&#8217t always play nice with others. We need to learn how to manage and optimize our CSS no matter how large the project or diverse the team. If we start early, we can use best practises and tools to riase full-grown stylesheets any designer or developer would be happy to work with.</p>

            <h5>Designing to Learn</h5>

            <p>We&#8127ve reached a point where non-designers understand the value of design. This has led to an increase in demand for design talent. In the past, we would have turned to institutions of higher education to help us find new talent; however, today&#8217s graduates often finish school without the skills they need to thrive in a professional design setting.
            <br>There is a massive gap between what students learn and what industry needs. This skills gap leaves graduates unable to find jobs and hiring companies unable to find talent. How we approach this challenge will affect the continued relevance and value of design.</p>

Hang out for a quick dive into the life of Jim Henson, with a view into his work from the perspective of how it pertains to what it is we&#8217re doing today, that promises to even leave Waldorf and Statler happy.</p>

            <h5>Leveling Up with Flexbox</h5>

            <p>By now, you&#8127ve probably heard of "Flexbox," short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout module and the most fully developed and well supported CSS3&#8217s wide array of new layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we&#8127ve dealt with for over a decade. But with cross-browser support still incomplete, you&#8127ve probably relegated flexbox to the "one day" pile of web design tricks
            <br>It&#8217s time to stop waiting, In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you that it&#8217s a good idea to start learning and using flexbox today. You&#8217ll learn how to take your designs - and web design skills - to the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive enhancemen, adding it in bits and pieceson individual page components with graceful fallbacks.
